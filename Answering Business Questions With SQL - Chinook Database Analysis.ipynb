    "# Using SQL To Answer Business Questions on the Chinook Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use SQL to answer business questions on the Chinook company database. Chinook is a fictional online music store that sells music in a variety of formats. This database contains information about Chinook's sales, employees, and customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will run queries with the goal of answering the following questions:\n",
    "- We have a choice of 4 new albums to purchase, each from a different genre. Which ones should we choose?\n",
    "- How can we compare the performance of our company's sales agents?\n",
    "- Where are most of our sales? Which countries offer the best business opportunities?\n",
    "- Should we keep selling full albums, or just sell individual tracks?\n",
    "- Which artist is used most in playlists?\n",
    "- How many tracks have been purchased vs. not purchased?\n",
    "- What tracks, albums, and artists are most popular? \n",
    "- Is the range of tracks in the store reflective of their sales popularity? Are there any undervalued genres to expand in, or genres to cut back Chinook's offerings?\n",
    "- Do protected vs. non-protected music formats impact sales?"

Since this data shows that Punk, Pop and Blues are the 3 best selling of these 4 genres, Chinook may want to purchase the albums from Red Tone (Punk), Meteor and the Girls (Pop), and Slim Jim Bites (Blues). It is worth noting that there was very little difference in the popularity of Pop vs. Hip Hop (.19%), and each of these genres made up about 2% of total sales. Therefore, if Chinook was particularly interested in expanding its Hip Hop inventory, we could elect to purchase the Hip Hop album instead of the Pop album.\n",

Of the top 10 most popular playlist artists, 4 are Rock and 2 are Metal; the other 6 are from a range of different genres. However, if we look at all the playlists in the Chinook database, we see that there are only 14 playlists with tracks added to them; their sizes range from 1 track to over 3,000 tracks. As a result, those large numbers of tracks may only be coming from several specific playlists. For example, Iron Maiden appears only on 4 playlists, including 213 tracks on two of those playlists. This may respresent big Iron Maiden fans who are adding all available Iron Maiden tracks to their playlists.\n",

The top 10 artists who appeared in the largest number of playlists were all Classical music, appearing on 5-7 playlists, with 5-15 tracks each. Four playlists have \"Classical\" in their title. There may be more demand for general classical music playlists, as opposed to fans of a specific classical artist."

    "In general, the range of tracks available for sale was reflective of that genre's popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the 3 top selling genres had a larger variety of tracks available than other genres:\n",
    "* Rock - 55% of total sales, 1297 tracks available (37% of tracks available for purchase)\n",
    "* Metal - 13% of total sales, 374 tracks available (10% of tracks available for purchase)\n",
    "* Alternative & Punk - 10% of total sales, 332 tracks available (9% of tracks available for purchase)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Rock genre, 70% of tracks available have sold. The same is true of 63% of Metal tracks and 53% of Alternative & Punk tracks. Rock was by far the most represented genre in the top ten selling artists, albums, and tracks, followed by Metal. Chinook may want to continue to expand its music offerings in Rock and possibly Metal, or advertize its current catalog in these genres, as these are the best selling genres in the store. A relatively high percentage of Rock and Metal tracks sell, so additional purchases in these areas may be low-risk opportunities to increase business. As noted before, specific artists within these genres are especialy popular with our customers (i.e. Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana), so any additional offerings from these artists (i.e. rare recordings) would likely sell well.\n",
    "\n",
    "One noteable exception to this popularity vs. representation trend is the Latin genre, which represented only 3% of total sales but had 579 tracks available (16% of total tracks available for purchase). Moreover, only 20% of Latin tracks available at Chinook have ever been sold. As a result, Chinook may want to consider dropping some of these tracks from its collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 genres that have not sold any tracks (Bossa Nova, Comedy, Opera, Rock and Roll, Sci Fi & Fantasy, Science Fiction, and World). 4 additional genres account for less than .5% of sales each (Heavy Metal, Sound Track, TV Shows, and Drama), and have sold less than a quarter of their tracks. Chinook may want to consider eliminating these offerings as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 genres that may currently be underrepresented in the store, and where Chinook may want to experiment with expanding its offerings: Easy Listening, Electronic/Dance, R&B/Soul, and Alternative. Each of these genres currently accounts for a small percentage of total offerings (.69-1.74%) and sales (1-3% each). However, these genres are selling at a disproportionately rate as compared with the size of their inventory. As an example, the Alternative genre represents only 1.14% of tracks available in the store, but accounts for 2.46% of total sales. 85% of Alternative tracks have sold, in comparison to about half of tracks across our entire store. Chinook may want to experiment with a small expansion of offerings and/or advertising in these potentially underrepresented genres."

About 90% of tracks sold were non-protected, compared with about 87% of tracks available for purchase. Looking at this data, it is unclear WHY this format is by far the most popular. It could be because MPEG is the most common file type for sale at Chinook or because customers specifically like MPEG files. From this data alone, we can't determine if customers prefer to buy non-protected tracks, or if non-protected tracks are more popular simply because they make up the vast majority of our inventory."

    "## Project Summary \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed sales data from the fictional music store Chinook's database, using SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We analyzed this data to answer the following business questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What new albums should Chinook purchase, based on sales data for different genres of music?\n",
    "* What artists, tracks, and albums are most popular?\n",
    "* Is the range of tracks for sale reflective of their popularity? Are there areas where Chinook should add to or reduce its inventory?\n",
    "* What does sales data tell us about the performance of different employees in the sales department?\n",
    "* Should Chinook continue selling full albums, or just sell popular tracks from albums?\n",
    "* What can we learn from comparing sales data across different countries? Where is the highest volume of sales, and the higheset average sale value per customer? Are there areas where Chinook could expand its business?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How this project helped me grow my skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "I gained a lot of experience writing and tweaking SQL queries. I felt my fluency with SQL improving as I moved through this project, especially as I was able to ask and answer my own questions on this data. I learned how to construct more complex queries peice by peice, as an iterative process. I am now more confident in understanding exactly what a query will produce, and better able do a quick \"sanity check\" on the results. I am beginning to understand how and when to use WITH, VIEW and CASE better, including to loop through a dataset looking for matches to a condition. Next, I'd like to continue to gain more fluency with SQL, especially with writing more complex queries and WITH, VIEW and CASE. I'd also like to practice using SQL with a larger dataset."
