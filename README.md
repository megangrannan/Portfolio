# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal project portfolio!

My current projects are:
* **Analysis of Popular Topics on Data Science Stack Exchange** - Imagine you are a company creating data science related courses and content - what new content should you add? I analyze data from Data Science Stack Exchange and Cross Validated Stack Exchange to identify popular topics, track interest in these topics over time, and look for associations between popular tags.
