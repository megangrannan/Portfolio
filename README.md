# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal project portfolio!

My current projects are:

* **Analysis of Popular Topics on Data Science Stack Exchange** - Imagine you are a company creating data science related courses and content - what new content should you add? I analyze data from Data Science Stack Exchange and Cross Validated Stack Exchange to identify popular topics, track interest in these topics over time, and look for associations between popular tags. I query a database to get data, analyze the data using Python and related libraries, and include a variety of visualizations to better illustrate the findings.

* **Answering Business Questions with SQL - Chinook Record Store Database Analysis** - We are a fictional online record store looking to answer a number of business questions using information from our database. What new records should we purchase? Where are most of our sales happening, and are there countries we should expand in? What are our best selling albums, artists, tracks and genres? Based on this, are there any areas where we should expand or reduce our inventory? I use SQL and Python to explore these questions.
