# Portfolio

Welcome to my personal project portfolio!

My current projects are:

* **Coach Viva Database and Dashboard for KPIs** - Code excerpts from my work with Coach Viva, a health and fitness company. <br /> **Project Goal**: Develop analytics system to convert Vivaâ€™s sales funnel into a predictable revenue machine.
    - Collaborated with co-founders to determine metrics for KPIs
    - Extracted data from multiple sources (Google Analytics, YouTube Analytics/APIs, ConvertKit email service provider, Bitly, web scraping) and segmented by traffic source (i.e.     social media, sales funnel pages) to calculate KPIs
    - Designed and built NoSQL database to store KPI data using Google Firestore
    - Collaborated with CTO to develop a data management web app to automatically update database on a monthly basis, using Heroku and Flask

* **Analysis of Popular Topics on Data Science Stack Exchange** - Imagine you are a company creating data science related courses and content - what new content should you add? I analyze data from Data Science Stack Exchange and Cross Validated Stack Exchange to identify popular topics, track interest in these topics over time, and look for associations between popular tags. I query a database to get data, analyze the data using Python and related libraries, and include a variety of visualizations to better illustrate the findings.

* **Answering Business Questions with SQL - Chinook Record Store Database Analysis** - We are a fictional online record store looking to answer a number of business questions using information from our database. What new records should we purchase? Where are most of our sales happening, and are there countries we should expand in? What are our best selling albums, artists, tracks and genres? Based on this, are there any areas where we should expand or reduce our inventory? I use SQL and Python to explore these questions.

* **Coach Viva Customer Data Analysis** - Code excerpts from my work with Coach Viva, a health and fitness company. <br /> 
**Project Goal**: We will analyze data from ConvertKit's API to answer the following questions: <br /> 
    -   Which tags and topics are the most popular among our email subscribers?
    -   What can we learn about our subscribers' purchasing patterns?
    -   How long were subscribers on our list before making their first purchase? Did this vary by product purchased?
    -   What percentage of our subscribers have made a purchase? How does this vary in relation to time on our email list?
    -   What recommendations can we make based on this analysis?
