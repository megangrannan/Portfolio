It is worth noting that there was very little difference in the popularity of Pop vs. Hip Hop (.15%), and each of these genres made up about 2% of total sales.

different ways. First, we can look at which artist's tracks appear most frequently. We can also consider the number of playlists an artist appears in.\n"," \n","The most frequently appearing artist in playlists is Iron Maiden, whose tracks appeared 516 times. They are followed by U2, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple. Of the top 10 most popular playlist artists, 4 are Rock and 2 are Metal; the other 6 are from a range of different genres. However, if we look at all the playlists in the Chinook database, we see that there are only 14 playlists with tracks added to them; their sizes range from 1 track to over 3,000 tracks. As a result, those large numbers of tracks may only be coming from several specific playlists. For example, Iron Maiden appears only on 4 playlists, including 213 tracks on two of those playlists. This may respresent big Iron Maiden fans who are adding all available Iron Maiden tracks to their playlist.\n","\n","If we measure artist popularity in playlists by the number of playlists an artist appears on, we get very different results. The top 10 artists who appeared in the largest number of playlists were all classical music, appearing on 5-7 playlists, with 5-15 tracks each. Four playlists have \"Classical\" in their title. There may be demand for general classical music playlists, as opposed to fans of a specific classical artist."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UL0ffMUUXQ83","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":false,"id":"UWIMlCWYXQ85","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"6d76c258-a36d-4605-cf7d-55886da0fa63"},"source":["%%sql\n","WITH no_purchased AS\n","    (\n","    SELECT \n","        track_id,\n","        COUNT(track_id) no_tracks\n","    FROM invoice_line\n","    GROUP BY 1\n","    )\n","    \n","SELECT\n","    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM no_purchased) tracks_purchased,\n","    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track) - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM no_purchased) as tracks_not_purchased,\n","    ROUND(CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM no_purchased) as float) / CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track) as float) * 100, 2) percent_purchased,\n","    ROUND(CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track) - (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM no_purchased) as float) / CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track) as float) * 100, 2) percent_not_purchased\n","FROM track t\n","LEFT JOIN no_purchased np on np.track_id = t.track_id\n","GROUP BY 1;"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Done.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<table>\n","    <tr>\n","        <th>tracks_purchased</th>\n","        <th>tracks_not_purchased</th>\n","        <th>percent_purchased</th>\n","        <th>percent_not_purchased</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>1806</td>\n","        <td>1697</td>\n","        <td>51.56</td>\n","        <td>48.44</td>\n","    </tr>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["[(1806, 1697, 51.56, 48.44)]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vbLMv4sAXQ9F","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"493fef29-f4df-4e84-f349-48954528e64e"},"source":["%%sql\n","SELECT\n","    COUNT(*)\n","FROM track"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Done.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<table>\n","    <tr>\n","        <th>COUNT(*)</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>3503</td>\n","    </tr>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["[(3503,)]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1Z3gw87WXQ9P","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Out of 3503 tracks available in Chinook's store, 1806 have been purchased, and 1697 have not been.

The same is true of 63% of Metal tracks and 53% of Alternative & Punk tracks. Rock was by far the most represented genre in the top ten selling artists, albums, and tracks, followed by metal. Chinook may want to continue to expand its music offerings in Rock and possibly Metal, or advertize its current catalog in these genres, as these are the best selling genres in the store. A relatively high percentage of Rock and Metal tracks sell, so additional purchases in these areas may be low-risk opportunities to increase business.\n","\n","One noteable exception to this is the Latin genre, which represented only 3% of total sales but had 579 tracks available (16% of total tracks available for purchase). Moreover, only 20% of Latin tracks available at Chinook have ever been sold.

Each of these genres currently accounts for a small percentage of total offerings (.69-1.74%) and sales (1-3% each). However, these genres are selling a disproportionately high number and percentage of their tracks as compared to other offerings in the store. Chinook could experiment with a small expansion of offerings and/or advertising in these genres."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hwGl664HXQ-o","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Do protected vs non-protected media types have an effect on popularity?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"AEBsRwjJXQ-r","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"05f75343-e089-4184-c881-bac4a1799cef"},"source":["%%sql\n","WITH media_info AS\n","    (\n","    SELECT\n","        COUNT(DISTINCT track_id) num_tracks,\n","        t.media_type_id,\n","        mt.name media_type,\n","        t.track_id\n","    FROM track t\n","    LEFT JOIN media_type mt on mt.media_type_id = t.media_type_id\n","    GROUP BY 2\n","    )\n","\n","SELECT \n","    mi.media_type media_type,\n","    COUNT(ti.track_id) tracks_sold,\n","    ROUND(CAST(COUNT(ti.track_id) as float) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track_info) * 100, 2) percentage_total_sold,\n","    ROUND(CAST(mi.num_tracks as float) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM track) * 100, 2) percentage_available_tracks, \n","    CASE\n","        WHEN mi.media_type LIKE '%Protected%'\n","            THEN 'Protected'\n","        ELSE 'Non-Protected'\n","        END AS protected\n","FROM track_info ti\n","LEFT JOIN media_info mi on ti.media_type_id = mi.media_type_id\n","LEFT JOIN track t on t.track_id = ti.track_id\n","GROUP BY 1\n","ORDER BY 2 DESC"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Done.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<table>\n","    <tr>\n","        <th>media_type</th>\n","        <th>tracks_sold</th>\n","        <th>percentage_total_sold</th>\n","        <th>percentage_available_tracks</th>\n","        <th>protected</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>MPEG audio file</td>\n","        <td>4259</td>\n","        <td>89.53</td>\n","        <td>86.61</td>\n","        <td>Non-Protected</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>Protected AAC audio file</td>\n","        <td>439</td>\n","        <td>9.23</td>\n","        <td>6.77</td>\n","        <td>Protected</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>Purchased AAC audio file</td>\n","        <td>35</td>\n","        <td>0.74</td>\n","        <td>0.2</td>\n","        <td>Non-Protected</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>AAC audio file</td>\n","        <td>21</td>\n","        <td>0.44</td>\n","        <td>0.31</td>\n","        <td>Non-Protected</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>Protected MPEG-4 video file</td>\n","        <td>3</td>\n","        <td>0.06</td>\n","        <td>6.11</td>\n","        <td>Protected</td>\n","    </tr>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["[('MPEG audio file', 4259, 89.53, 86.61, 'Non-Protected'),\n"," ('Protected AAC audio file', 439, 9.23, 6.77, 'Protected'),\n"," ('Purchased AAC audio file', 35, 0.74, 0.2, 'Non-Protected'),\n"," ('AAC audio file', 21, 0.44, 0.31, 'Non-Protected'),\n"," ('Protected MPEG-4 video file', 3, 0.06, 6.11, 'Protected')]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DCKkHq_ZXQ--","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Out of the 5 media types available, MPEG is by far the most popular, representing 89% of tracks sold and 86% of tracks available for purchase. This file format is non-protected. About 90% of tracks sold were non-protected, compared with about 87% of tracks available for purchase. Looking at this data, it is unclear WHY this format is by far the most popular. It could be because MPEG is the most common file type for sale at Chinook or because customers specifically like MPEG files. Since the other non-protected file formats made up only a tiny portion of Chinook's sales, customers may not care if a file is protected or not when purchasing music."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MTcbS09FXQ_A","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Project Summary \n","\n","In this project, we analyzed sales data from the Chinook music store's database, using SQL queries.\n","\n","#### Some specific business questions we answered include:\n","\n","* What new albums should Chinook purchase, based on sales data for different genres of music?\n","* What artists, tracks, and albums are most popular?\n","* Is the range of tracks for sale reflective of their popularity? Are there areas where Chinook should add to or reduce its offerings?\n","* What does sales data tell us about the performance of different employees in the sales department?\n","* Should Chinook continue selling full albums, or just sell select tracks from albums?\n","* What can we learn from comparing sales data across different countries? Where is the highest volume of sales, and average sales per customer? Are there areas where Chinook could expand its business?\n","\n","#### How this project helped me grow my skills:\n","\n","I gained a lot of experience writing and tweaking SQL queries. I felt my fluency with SQL improving as a moved through this project, especially as I was able to ask and answer some of my own questions on this data. I learned how to construct more complex queries peice by peice, as an iterative process. I am now more confident in understanding exactly what a query will produce, and better able to tell if it is producing what I intended vs. an unreasonable response. I am beginning to understand how and when to use WITH, VIEW and CASE better, including to loop through a dataset looking for matches to a condition. Next, I'd like to continue to gain more fluency with SQL, especially with writing more complex queries and WITH, VIEW and CASE. I'd also like to gain confidence using SQL with a larger dataset."]}]}
